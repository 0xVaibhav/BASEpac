      <p className="text-xl">We are excited to introduce a new portal dedicated to project submissions, drawing inspiration from the innovative capabilities of Coinbase and BASE protocol. This platform will provide an opportunity for users to showcase their projects, which will be rigorously evaluated by our expert panel based on quality and functionality.</p>
      <p className="text-3xl mt-4">Projects will be categorized into one of four tiers:</p>
        <li>Intern</li>
        <li>Junior Developer</li>
        <li>Senior Developer</li>
        <li>CTO(Cheif Technological Officer)</li>
        <p className="text-xl mt-2">Each tier reflects the project's level of sophistication and execution. Based on their ranking, projects will earn "extra clicks" that can be further redeemed for ETH. This incentive aims to encourage high-quality submissions and active participation. It's important to note that only projects utilizing BASE protocol and Coinbase functionalities will be eligible for submission.</p>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-4 mb-2">Engaging the Web3 Community</h1>
        <p className="text-xl">Our goal is to create an inclusive environment that attracts both beginners and experienced developers. By offering this platform, we aim to facilitate a seamless entry into the web3 space, leveraging the power of the BASE protocol. This initiative is designed to foster a community of innovative thinkers and creators, supporting their journey in exploring and mastering web3 technologies.</p>
